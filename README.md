# Springboot_Curd_Operations

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Java, Spring, and MySQL by creating a simple application that interacts with a relational database.

**Key Features:**

* **Spring Boot:** Leverages the Spring Boot framework for rapid application development, including dependency injection, auto-configuration, and embedded servers.
* **MySQL:** Utilizes MySQL as the underlying database for data storage and retrieval.
* **JPA and Hibernate:** Employs Java Persistence API (JPA) and Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer to interact with the database using Java objects.
* **CRUD Operations:** Implements core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a chosen entity (e.g., a User, Product) through a RESTful API.
* **RESTful API:** Exposes endpoints (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with the data using HTTP requests.

**Technical Steps:**

**1. Project Setup:**

*   Create a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
*   Use Java version 17 or higher and Maven.
*   Add dependencies for:
    *   Spring Web
    *   Spring Data JPA
    *   MySQL Driver
    *   Lombok

**2. Project Setup (After Cloning):**

*   Run `mvn clean install` in the terminal to download all dependencies.

**3. Database Setup:**

*   Create a database named `newdb` using the following SQL command:
    ```sql
    create database newdb;
    ```
*   **Important:** Update the `username` and `password` in the `pom.xml` file with your MySQL credentials.

**4. Run the Application:**

*   Start the Spring Boot application.
*   Use a tool like Postman to interact with the exposed RESTful endpoints.

**5. Explore and Experiment:**

*   Test the CRUD operations using Postman.
*   Modify the entity, service, and controller classes to explore different functionalities.

**This project provides a solid foundation for understanding core Spring Boot concepts and building more complex applications with database interactions.**
